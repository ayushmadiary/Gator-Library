The application performs the role of a library simulation by using a command- driven methodology to control different library functionalities. In this case, reservations, books, and customers are managed by a class called GatorLibrary. A variety of actions are available to users, including adding new books, monitoring the color flip count of an internal Red-Black Tree, printing comprehensive information about individual books, borrowing and returning books, locating the nearest book using an ID, removing books, and more. To provide quick and effective searches, books must be arranged according to their IDs using the Red-Black Tree. A specified file is the source of input commands, and an output file contains the results of these actions.
